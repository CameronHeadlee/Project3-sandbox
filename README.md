## Details
This application is aimed towards creating a community around displaying and re-selling sneakers. It allows users to create and to present their own closet of shoes in addition to selecting the pairs they want to sell. Fellow sneakerheads can write seller reviews as well as contact each other in a secure setting to increase transparency in the process of selling their collectables. With special features including your personal curated closet and direct communication with sellers, Sneakerheads is a great way to engage with fellow shoe enthusiasts. 

## Instructions
To view the application, navigate to Heroku and download. When the user first enters the site, they will not have access to the entirety of the application such as creating their own closet of shoes to sell or messaging sellers. These features require the user to create an account and subsequently log in using their email and username.

## Technologies 
This application uses a React front end along with GraphQl, Bootstrap 4, and JavaScript.
